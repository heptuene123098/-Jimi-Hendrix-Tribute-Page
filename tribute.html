            <p><strong>Castles Made Of Sand</strong></p>
            <p>Down the street, you can hear her scream, "You're a disgrace"</p>
            <p>As she slams the door in his drunken face </p>
            <p>And now he stands outside</p>
            <p>And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool</p>
            <p>cries, "Oh girl, you must be mad</p>
            <p>What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"</p>
            <p>Against the door he leans and starts a scene</p>
            <p>his tears fall and burn on the garden green</p> 
            <p>so castles made of sand</p> 
            <p>Fall in the sea</p>
            <p>Eventually</p>
            <p>A little Indian brave who before he was ten</p>
            <p>Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends</p>
            <p>And he built a dream that when he grew up</p>
            <p>He would be a fierce warrior Indian chief</p>
            <p>Many moons passed 'fore the dream grew strong</p>
            <p>Until tomorrow he would sing his first war song</p>
            <p>And fight his first battle, but something went wrong</p>
            <p>Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night</p>
            <p>And so castles made of sand</p>
            <p>Melts into the sea</p>
            <p>Eventually</p>
            <p>There was a young girl whose heart was a frown</p>
            <p>Because she was crippled for life, and she couldn't speak a sound</p>
            <p>And she wished and prayed she could stop living</p>
            <p>So she decided to die</p>
            <p>She drove her wheelchair to the edge of the shore</p>
            <p>And to her legs she smiled, "You won't hurt me no more"</p>
            <p>But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say</p>
            <p>"Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way"</p>
            <p>And it really didn't ever stop</p>
            <p>It just kept on going</p>
            <p>And so castles made of sand</p>
            <p>Slips into the sea</p>
            <p>Eventually</p>
